# Hotel Simple UI

This is a **basic user interface for a friend's hotel** — built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

**To run locally:**

npm run dev

or
yarn dev

or
pnpm dev

or
bun dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the site.

You can start customizing the page by editing `app/page.js`. Changes auto-update as you save the file.

## About

## Tech Stack
